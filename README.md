Virtual Cluster Embedding Simulation

The following java files define basic classes for data centers, and virtual clusters.

Rack.java

DataCenter.java

VirtualCluster.java

VirtualClusterSet.java

VirtualClusterEmbedding.java is the main simulation file. The goal of the project is to find the better virtual cluster
embedding algorithm such that the core bandwidth usage of all the multicast-capable virtual clusters is minimized.
